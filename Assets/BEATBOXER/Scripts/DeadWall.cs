        /*****
        In the above Destroy() method call, you are searching for a Rigid body component, on the first available game object, that is a parent,
        of the object (red/blue cube) that collided with the dead wall.
        Your red/blue cube object, nested within the mesh container, is the one that sports the box collider setup as a trigger,
        so collision can only be detected against this nested red/blue cube that has a box collider on it.  
        However, you need to destroy the topmost parent object, within which your red/blue cube is nested. 
        That is you need to destroy the instantiated,Interactions.Interactable_Blue or Red cube game objects actually,which in turn destroys its nested child objects. 
        You will find that the Rigidbody only exists at this topmost,Interactions.Interactable_Blue/Red cube game object,so you need to locate this Rigidbody first.
        Then once this Rigidbody is locted and returned to you, you access the game object it was attached to, 
        which would be the Interactions.Interactable_Blue/Red cube game object, the topmost parent object, of your red/blue nested cubes.
        Once you have this game object returned, your Destroy() method above destroys it, in essence destroying the entire cube block.
